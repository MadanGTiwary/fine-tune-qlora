Quick question: Langchain seems very integrated with OpenAI's API and software packages; have you tried using Langchain with an open-sourced free of charge LLM?  Thanks!  I am trying to build an LLM based app for a portfolio for PhD application in AI. \n[/INST]\nThanks for the kind words, I'm glad you like the videos. While I've only used LangChain with OpenAI's API, it is has integrations with many other LLM providers. Here's more on how to use it with HF: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/huggingface -MGT</s>"}

For example, can you infer the effect of an event (a tweet from Bidon) to an uprise of S&P index? \n[/INST]\nI can see it working for time series after a little data preparation. One-time events feel more challenging but I\u2019m sure there is something out there for those too. -MGT</s>"}
