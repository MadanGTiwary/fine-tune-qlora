In the Gaussian example I would expect x to be wealth that increases from left to right and y to be the number of observations. Yet with that in mind, shouldn't the Pareto curve be such that x=w from low to high, with at the bottom a lot of observations and only very few at the high end of wealth? How is it that it typically explained that the 20% of the bottom end of the x-axis have 80% of everything? \n[/INST]\nGood question. Supposing wealth follows the given Pareto distribution, X could be net worth and P(X=x) is the probability that a random selection from the population will have net worth equal to x. The long tail here reflects the intuition that there are many more people with net worths around $100,000 than $100,000,000, since the as x increases P(X=x) decreases. The 80-20 rule comes in when you add up all the wealth of to the top 20%, you would get about 80% of the total wealth in the population. Hope that clears things up, happy to expand on any point. -MGT</s>"}

According to wikipedia, for Daubechies wavelets the number in db1 refers to the number of vanishing moments. For Symlets, these are created from Daubechies wavelets so I assume sym4 means it is generated from the db4 wavelet. -MGT</s>"}
