I'm a researcher with a PhD in NLP who trains LLMs from scratch for a living and often find myself in need of communicating the process in a way that's digestible to a broad audience without back and forth question answering, so I'm thrilled to have found your piece!

Did you take the variable loadings of each of the 21 PCs? Was that your data frame? I am trying to do this for financial data, would be awesome if you took the output of your PCA video and ran ICA on top of that \n[/INST]\nHey, thanks for the question! The transformed EEG signals (i.e. 21 principal components) are what are fed into the ICA function. The data structure is an array where rows correspond to time points and columns to each of the principal components. That sounds like a cool idea! It should be simple to implement. If you are using sklearn, you can use a X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X) to get the transformed data, then a X_ica = ica.fit_transform(X_pca) to apply ICA to the principal components.

Like everytime the resulting signal without blink is different in shape and amplitude, is that normal? Also, when I plot the original data (64 channels) vs the resulting data_noblink, each channel is not consistent regarding its positions (like data from channel 1 (Data(:,1)) is now in Data(:,6) and so on. My question is, is there a random effect of using ICA that I didn't catch when inverse PCA transform happens? if so, can I use a seed or similar to control this randomness? \n[/INST]\nGreat question. The ICA implementation here introduces randomness into the code. Quickly skimming the MATLAB doc, it's not immediately obvious how one can control it, but I have provided the link below for you reference. https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/rica.html#bvnjjp8-5 Hope that helps! -MGT</s>"}

T(m,n) is the coefficient corresponding to the basis wavelet with scale m and location n. Scale sets how \"stretched\" or \"squished\" the wavelet is, while the location sets where the wavelet is positioned. The first plot shown in the example, shown these coefficents for each choice of scale (e.g. 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, ...) and each choice of location i.e. time (x-axis). I hope the clears things up! -MGT</s>"}

Thanks for the video and the code. \n[/INST]\nThe answer to your question is yes. Both are good! Each extract different information. Wavelet transform does a good job at capturing localized oscillations (like a blip or a chirp) in time series. FFT is great at getting global frequency information, meaning oscillations that persist over the whole signal. You can also \"chop up\" your EEG signals into epochs in which you perform an FFT, or even further, do sliding window over the entire signal and compute the FFT at each instance.

The short answer is yes. This is what is used for Trick 2, where your validation metric serves as a score. One I have come across is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is mentioned briefly in reference [1] on slide 6. However, I am sure there are others out there. Now, the nuanced answer depends on what you mean by validate. Generally we do not know the true DAG that describes our system of interest. In such cases, we have to be careful about how we evaluate the efficacy of the DAG, since we have no ground truth from which to compare. For example, BIC balances the DAG's ability to generate the underlying data with a penalty for the number of parameters (i.e. nodes and edges). Hope that helps! -MGT</s>"}

T(m,n) is the coefficient corresponding to the basis wavelet with scale m and location n. Scale sets how \"stretched\" or \"squished\" the wavelet is, while the location sets where the wavelet is positioned. The first plot shown in the example, shown these coefficents for each choice of scale (e.g. 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, ...) and each choice of location i.e. time (x-axis). I hope the clears things up! -MGT</s>"}

Isn't it? Which variables/nodes from the DAG are the covariates (Z)? Or you just include every other variable available? \n[/INST]\nThat\u2019s a good question. I would recommend constructing a DAG as a first step to any causal analysis but it is not strictly required for these regression-based techniques. I would be cautious about (blindly) including all other available variables in the analysis. My intuition on this is it comes down to Berkson\u2019s paradox. There is a nice write up by Judea pearl on this issue: https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r348.pdf This is one reason why a DAG is helpful -MGT</s>"}

I have a question. Is it possible to have more than 1 output in a supervised way? For example: {\"input\": \"ddddddd\", \"output1\":\"dddd\",\"eeee\", \"ffffff\", \"output2\": \"xxxx\", \"zzzzz\", etc} Thx \n[/INST]\nGood question. I'd say it depends on the use case and the meaning of the outputs. However, here are 2 thoughts. 1) concatenate \"output1\" and \"output2\" to make \"output\" e.g. \"output1\":\"dddd\",\"eeee\", \"ffffff\" + \"output2\": \"xxxx\", \"zzzzz\", = \"output\":\"dddd\", \"eeee\", \"ffffff\", \"xxxx\", \"zzzzz\" 2) train 2 models, one for \"output1\" and another for \"output2\" Hope that helps! -MGT</s>"}

Do you know is it possible to create an own LLM  for own startup? \n[/INST]\nOf course this is possible. However, it is rarely necessary. I'd suggest seeking simpler (and cheaper) solutions before jumping to training an LLM from scratch. -MGT</s>"}

These are different things. Tokenization is the process of taking a some text and deriving a vocabulary from which the original text can be generated, where each element in the vocabulary is assigned a unique integer value. Text embeddings on the other hand, take tokens and translate them into meaningful (numerical) representations. I talk a little more about tokenization here: https://youtu.be/czvVibB2lRA?si=FwqmkB9Ltyq45n0w&t=348 -MGT</s>"}

The short answer is RAG can handle this sort of data (at least in principle). The longer answer involves taking a step back and asking oneself \"why do I want to use RAG/LLMs/AI for this use case?\" This helps get to the root of the problem you are trying to solve and hopefully give more clarity about potential solutions. -MGT</s>"}

But there are also an AI Engineer role & AI Product Manager roles. Where does it fit in? \n[/INST]\nGreat question. AI Engineer seems to be a new one. I've mainly seen this from data science or ML engineering freelancers rebranding themselves for a non-technical audience. So they will likely have a similar skillset to a full-stack data scientist (as I describe it here). The AI Product Manager is one step beyond a full-stack data scientist in that they implement products rather than projects. This requires additional considerations such as sales, marketing, finding product market fit, and other business skills. -MGT</s>"}

It would be nice to see a video of fine tuning ShawGPT using HF, I saw a video you did running on Colab using Mistal-7b, any chance to do a video using your laptop (Mac) or using HF spaces? \n[/INST]\nThanks for the great suggestions! The QLoRA video uses HF to implement another version of ShawGPT using Colab. I plan on doing a future video on local fine-tuning on Mac with Llama3. -MGT</s>"}
